# Starfinder Character Generator Version 2

This new version of the Starfinder Character Gen now features multi-view support and event aggregation between views, an MVVM framework,
a WPF GUI with XAML markup, data binding (both manual and Caliburn naming conventions) and It takes advantage of a Library 
I constructed from my old project. 
The UI is much more pleasing to the eye and because it’s done in XAML, it’s extremely responsive!
I'm also including a "cheat mode" that will allow more freedom in character creation in case your character doesn't fit a partucular
mold for one reason or another.
