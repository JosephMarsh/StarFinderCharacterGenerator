# Starfinder Character Generator Version 2

This new Version of the Starfinder Character Creator now features multi-view support, Event Aggregation between views, MVVM frameworks,
WPF with XAML markup, Data Binding and It takes advantage or a Library I constructed from my old project. 
The UI is much more pleasing to the eye and because it’s done in XAML, it’s extremely responsive!
